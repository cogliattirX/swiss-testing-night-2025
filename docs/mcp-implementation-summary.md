- **Status**: ✅ Prerequisites met

### Phase 2: Server Startup & Troubleshooting
- **Initial Approach**: Attempted `npm run mcp:start` script
- **Issues Encountered**: Path resolution problems with npm script
- **Solution Implemented**: Direct execution via `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`
- **Result**: ✅ Server successfully started

### Phase 3: Configuration & Integration
- **Claude Desktop Config**: Created `claude_desktop_config.json` in user AppData
- **VS Code Integration**: Documented GitHub Copilot configuration requirements
- **Process Verification**: Confirmed Node.js processes running
- **Status**: ✅ Integration pathways established

### Phase 4: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created detailed setup guide

- **Status**: ✅ Knowledge captured and transferable

## Key Technical Learnings

### 1. Server Execution Methods
| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `npm run mcp:start` | ❌ Failed | Path resolution issues |
| `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` | ✅ Success | Reliable direct execution |
| Direct node execution | ⚠️ Partial | Complex path management |

### 2. Configuration Requirements
- **Working Directory**: Must execute from `test-automation` directory
- **Configuration Files**: Claude Desktop requires specific JSON structure
- **Process Management**: Server runs as background Node.js processes
- **Integration Points**: Multiple AI tools require different configuration approaches

### 3. Common Pitfalls & Solutions
- **npm Script Issues**: Script paths don't resolve correctly in workspace
- **Background Process**: Server must remain running for functionality
- **Configuration Location**: OS-specific paths for different AI tools
- **Restart Requirements**: AI tools need restart after configuration changes

## User Requirements & Implementation Guide

### Technical Prerequisites
✅ **Software Requirements**:
- Node.js v16+ with npm
- VS Code + GitHub Copilot extension OR Claude Desktop
- Playwright test project structure
- Terminal/PowerShell access

✅ **Knowledge Requirements**:
- Basic npm/npx command usage
- JSON configuration file editing
- Process monitoring concepts
- VS Code/AI tool restart procedures

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Environment Verification
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Verify package installation
npm ls @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server

# Confirm working directory
pwd  # Should be in test-automation folder
```

#### 2. Server Startup (Proven Method)
```bash
# Navigate to correct directory
cd test-automation

# Start MCP server
npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server

# Verify process running
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*node*"}
```

#### 3. AI Tool Configuration

**For GitHub Copilot Users**:
```json
// Add to VS Code settings.json
{
  "github.copilot.enableAutoCompletions": true,
  "github.copilot.conversation.enableAutoSuggest": true
}
```

**For Claude Desktop Users**:
```json
// Create %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"],
      "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\test-automation"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Integration Testing
```typescript
// Test prompt in any .spec.ts file
// "Create a comprehensive test for user login with error handling"
// Expected: Context-aware suggestions using project patterns
```
