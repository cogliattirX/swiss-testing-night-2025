Website Analysis Context:
${JSON.stringify(analysisResults, null, 2)}

Test Generation Requirements:
1. **Framework Compliance**: Use Playwright + TypeScript with Page Object Model
2. **Selector Strategy**: Prefer data-test attributes, fallback to stable CSS selectors
3. **Test Isolation**: Each test must be atomic and independent
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and meaningful assertions
5. **Performance**: Tests should execute efficiently for CI/CD integration
6. **Maintainability**: Clear naming, documentation, and reusable patterns

Specific ${testCategory} Test Requirements:
${this.getCategorySpecificRequirements(testCategory)}

Quality Standards:
- All tests must pass reliably across multiple environments
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios  
- Add meaningful assertions with descriptive error messages
- Follow accessibility testing patterns where applicable
- Include performance benchmarks for critical user journeys

Generate production-ready test code with proper TypeScript types and comprehensive coverage.
