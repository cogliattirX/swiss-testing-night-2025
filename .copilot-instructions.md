### Prompt Template:
```
As a [Persona] with [X]+ years of experience, focusing on [Key Concerns], 
I need to [Specific Task].

Context for Copilot:
[Include the Core Application Context above]

Consider that a [Critical Reviewer] will review this work focusing on [Review Areas].

Requirements:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [etc.]
```

## üîß Technical Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Test Structure Requirements:
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Pattern**: Page Object Model (create page classes when appropriate)
- **Selectors**: Prefer `data-test` attributes over CSS classes
- **Assertions**: Use explicit expectations with meaningful error messages
- **Waiting**: Use Playwright's auto-waiting, avoid arbitrary sleeps
- **Isolation**: Each test must be independent and atomic

### Code Quality Standards:
- **Naming**: Descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- **Comments**: Include JSDoc comments for complex test logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for external dependencies
- **Configuration**: Use playwright.config.ts settings, don't hardcode values

### Workshop Considerations:
- **Demonstrability**: Code must be easy to explain in 30-minute session
- **Reliability**: Tests must pass consistently across different environments
- **Learning Value**: Include comments explaining AI-specific testing patterns
