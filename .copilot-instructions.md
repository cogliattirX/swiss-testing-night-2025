# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Swiss Testing Night 2025

> **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE BEFORE GENERATING ANY CODE OR TESTS**
> This file contains essential context that must be included in all Copilot prompts.

## üéØ Project Context (REQUIRED IN ALL PROMPTS)

You are working on the **Swiss Testing Night 2025 Workshop** - a hands-on session demonstrating AI-powered QA with GitHub Copilot.

### Core Application Context
```
Context for Copilot:
- Target Application: Sauce Demo e-commerce site (https://www.saucedemo.com/)
- Framework: Playwright + TypeScript + MCP Server
- Architecture: Page Object Model pattern for maintainability
- Test Strategy: Follow test-automation/docs/test-strategy.md
- Personas: Apply persona-based review from copilot-context/enhanced-qa-team-personas.md
- Standards: Tests must be atomic, isolated, and deterministic
- Quality: Include meaningful assertions and comprehensive error handling
- Workshop Goal: Demonstrate AI-powered testing to QA professionals
```

## üß† Persona-Based Approach (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS start your prompts with a persona context:**

### Available Personas:
- ü§ñ **AI-Testing Specialist**: GitHub Copilot mastery, prompt engineering
- üîí **Security Testing Specialist**: Vulnerability testing, OWASP compliance
- ‚ôø **Accessibility Testing Expert**: WCAG compliance, inclusive design
- üì± **Cross-Platform Testing Engineer**: Multi-browser, responsive testing
- üìä **Test Data Management Specialist**: Privacy compliance, synthetic data
- üéì **QA Workshop Facilitator**: Training delivery, knowledge transfer
- üîß **QA Tools Integration Expert**: CI/CD optimization, automation frameworks
- üéØ **Performance Testing Engineer**: Load testing, scalability validation

### Prompt Template:
```
As a [Persona] with [X]+ years of experience, focusing on [Key Concerns], 
I need to [Specific Task].

Context for Copilot:
[Include the Core Application Context above]

Consider that a [Critical Reviewer] will review this work focusing on [Review Areas].

Requirements:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [etc.]
```

## üîß Technical Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Test Structure Requirements:
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Pattern**: Page Object Model (create page classes when appropriate)
- **Selectors**: Prefer `data-test` attributes over CSS classes
- **Assertions**: Use explicit expectations with meaningful error messages
- **Waiting**: Use Playwright's auto-waiting, avoid arbitrary sleeps
- **Isolation**: Each test must be independent and atomic

### Code Quality Standards:
- **Naming**: Descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- **Comments**: Include JSDoc comments for complex test logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for external dependencies
- **Configuration**: Use playwright.config.ts settings, don't hardcode values

### Workshop Considerations:
- **Demonstrability**: Code must be easy to explain in 30-minute session
- **Reliability**: Tests must pass consistently across different environments
- **Learning Value**: Include comments explaining AI-specific testing patterns

## üìã Quality Gates Checklist

Before accepting any generated code, verify:

### Technical Quality ‚úÖ
- [ ] Uses proper Playwright selectors and patterns
- [ ] Includes explicit waits (no arbitrary sleeps)
- [ ] Follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Has meaningful test names and descriptions
- [ ] Includes appropriate error handling

### Business Quality ‚úÖ  
- [ ] Tests realistic user scenarios for e-commerce
- [ ] Covers both happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Uses appropriate test data (standard_user, etc.)
- [ ] Validates business rules correctly

### Workshop Quality ‚úÖ
- [ ] Code is easy to explain and understand
- [ ] Tests run reliably in workshop environment
- [ ] Demonstrates AI-powered testing concepts
- [ ] Includes learning comments where appropriate

### Security & Compliance ‚úÖ
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Uses environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Follows security testing best practices
- [ ] Considers accessibility requirements

## üöÄ Common Use Cases & Templates

### 1. New Test Generation
```
As a [Primary Persona], create a Playwright test that:
1. [Specific user flow step 1]
2. [Specific user flow step 2]
3. [Specific validation requirements]

Context for Copilot: [Include full context above]

Apply the [Specific Testing Strategy] and ensure a [Critical Reviewer] 
reviewing this would approve for [Specific Quality Concerns].
```

### 2. Test Enhancement
```
As a [Enhancement Persona], improve the existing test [test-name] by:
- [Enhancement requirement 1]
- [Enhancement requirement 2]

Context for Copilot: [Include full context above]

Maintain backward compatibility and ensure [Quality Standard].
```

### 3. Debug/Fix Request
```
As a [Debugging Persona], the test [test-name] is failing with [error].
Please analyze and fix while maintaining [Quality Requirements].

Context for Copilot: [Include full context above]

Root cause analysis should consider [Specific Technical Areas].
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Generic Prompts**: Always include persona and context
2. **Hardcoded Values**: Use configuration and test data files
3. **Flaky Selectors**: Prefer stable data-test attributes
4. **Missing Reviews**: Always specify critical reviewer
5. **Workshop Mismatch**: Ensure code fits 30-minute demo format

## üéØ Success Validation

Generated code is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Passes all technical quality gates
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates clear AI-powered testing value
- ‚úÖ Can be explained effectively in workshop setting
- ‚úÖ Follows established project patterns and standards
- ‚úÖ Includes appropriate persona-based perspective

---

**Remember**: Every prompt should include the core context, specify a persona, and identify a critical reviewer. This ensures consistent, high-quality AI-generated testing code that serves the workshop's educational objectives.
