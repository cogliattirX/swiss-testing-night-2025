# Docker Configuration for Test Environment

## Dockerfile for Consistent Test Environment

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.39.0-focal

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY test-automation/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy test files
COPY test-automation/ ./

# Install browsers
RUN npx playwright install

# Default command
CMD ["npx", "playwright", "test"]
```

## Docker Compose for Development

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  playwright-tests:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./test-automation:/app
      - ./test-results:/app/test-results
    environment:
      - CI=true
    command: npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Security
- All test credentials use environment variables
- No sensitive data in repository
- Proper secrets management in CI/CD

### Performance
- Parallel test execution configured
- Browser reuse for faster runs
- Optimized Docker layers for caching

### Monitoring
- Test metrics collection
- Failure notification setup
- Performance regression detection

### Scalability
- Cloud-based test execution ready
- Multiple environment support
- Load testing capabilities planned
