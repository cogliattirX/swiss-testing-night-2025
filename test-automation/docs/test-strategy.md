# UI Test Strategy for Sauce Demo

## Test Scope and Objectives

### Application Under Test
The Sauce Demo website (https://www.saucedemo.com/) is an e-commerce platform that simulates a real-world shopping experience. It provides an excellent environment for demonstrating UI testing capabilities as it includes:
- Authentication system
- Product catalog
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Various UI states and error conditions

### Test Objectives
1. Validate critical user journeys
2. Ensure consistent functionality across different user roles
3. Verify error handling and edge cases
4. Demonstrate maintainable and scalable test automation

## Test Cases Overview

### 1. Authentication Suite
- **Login Validation Tests**
  - Successful login with standard user
  - Login attempts with locked user
  - Login with incorrect credentials
  - Login form validation
  - Logout functionality

### 2. Product Catalog Suite
- **Product Listing Tests**
  - Verify product grid display
  - Product sorting functionality
  - Product filtering options
  - Individual product details
  - Product image loading

### 3. Shopping Cart Suite
- **Cart Management Tests**
  - Add items to cart
  - Remove items from cart
  - Update quantities
  - Cart persistence across sessions
  - Price calculations

### 4. Checkout Process Suite
- **Checkout Flow Tests**
  - Checkout form validation
  - Shipping information handling
  - Payment information processing
  - Order confirmation
  - Order summary validation

### 5. Cross-functional Tests
- **Navigation and State Tests**
  - Menu functionality
  - Browser navigation (back/forward)
  - Session management
  - Responsive design validation

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Selection
We're using Playwright with MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for several reasons:
1. **Cross-browser Testing**: Native support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
2. **Modern Architecture**: Built for modern web apps with auto-wait functionality
3. **AI Integration**: MCP server enables AI-powered testing capabilities
4. **Performance**: Faster and more reliable than traditional Selenium-based solutions

### Test Structure
- Page Object Model for maintainability
- Data-driven approach for test data management
- Custom test hooks for setup and teardown
- Shared utilities for common operations

### Reporting and Monitoring
- Playwright HTML report generation
- Test execution logs
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Performance metrics collection

## Test Data Strategy

### User Accounts
- Standard user: standard_user
- Locked out user: locked_out_user
- Problem user: problem_user
- Performance glitch user: performance_glitch_user

### Test Data Management
- Static test data for predictable scenarios
- Dynamic data generation for edge cases
- Data cleanup after test execution
- Isolation between test runs

## Execution Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Playwright MCP server
- VS Code with recommended extensions

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Parallel test execution
- Scheduled regression runs
- Pull request validation

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### Test Reliability
- Explicit waits over implicit
- Unique and stable selectors
- Error handling and recovery
- Clean test data management

### Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review process
- Performance monitoring
- Technical debt management
