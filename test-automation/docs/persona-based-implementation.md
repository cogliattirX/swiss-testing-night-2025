## 🏗️ Agent 1: QA Test Architect (Strategy & Design)

### Role & Responsibilities
- Analyze test coverage gaps across existing test suite
- Design high-level test strategy and user workflow
- Identify cross-cutting concerns (security, accessibility, performance)
- Define test scenarios that maximize business value

### Contribution to Product Details Test

**Coverage Gap Analysis:**
```
Existing Coverage:
✅ Login authentication
✅ Shopping cart operations  
✅ Checkout flow
✅ Product sorting
✅ Navigation state

Missing Coverage:
❌ Product Details Page interactions
❌ Add to cart from detail view
❌ Product information validation
❌ Image accessibility on detail pages
```

**Strategic Test Design:**
1. **Primary Scenario**: End-to-end product detail workflow
   - Navigate from inventory → product details
   - Validate all product information elements
   - Add product to cart from details page
   - Verify state preservation across navigation

2. **Secondary Scenarios**:
   - Multiple product additions via detail pages
   - Direct cart navigation from product details

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
   - Security: XSS prevention in product descriptions
   - Accessibility: Alt text, heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation
   - Performance: Image loading, DOM size optimization

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Reusable `beforeEach` login flow (DRY principle)
- Step-based organization for workshop demonstration
- Observable actions for human-followable execution
- Comprehensive validation at each workflow stage

## 👨‍💻 Agent 2: Test Implementation Engineer (Code Implementation)

### Role & Responsibilities
- Transform architect's strategy into executable test code
- Apply observability framework patterns consistently
- Ensure TEST_MODE compatibility (ci/debug/demo/workshop)
- Write descriptive logging for workshop demonstrations

### Contribution to Product Details Test

**Framework Integration:**
```typescript
import { createObservableActions } from '../../../test-helpers/observability';

// Every test action uses observability wrapper
const actions = createObservableActions(page);

await actions.step('📖 Navigate to Product Details Page', async () => {
  await actions.observableClick('.inventory_item_name >> nth=0', '🖱️ Click first product');
  await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/inventory-item/);
  }, '✅ Verify navigation to product detail page');
});
```

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
1. **Step Organization**: Clear, descriptive step names with emoji prefixes
2. **Observable Actions**: All Playwright commands wrapped for visibility
3. **Descriptive Logging**: Console output for workshop demonstration
4. **State Management**: Tracking cart count before/after operations

**Code Quality Standards:**
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Consistent naming conventions
- Reusable test data (TEST_USER constant)
- Proper async/await patterns

**Workshop-Friendly Features:**
```typescript
console.log('🔍 Clicking on first product to view details...');
console.log(`📦 Selected product: ${productName} - ${productPrice}`);
console.log(`📊 Initial cart count: ${initialCount}`);
console.log(`🎉 Cart updated: ${initialCount} → ${initialCount + 1}`);
```

## 🔒 Agent 3: Security Testing Specialist (Security Validation)

### Role & Responsibilities
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in test scenarios
- Add XSS, injection, and data sanitization checks
- Validate trusted sources for external resources
- Ensure secure data flow across user interactions

### Contribution to Product Details Test

**Security Validations Implemented:**

**1. XSS Prevention in Product Content:**
```typescript
await actions.step('🔒 Security: Validate Product Information Display', async () => {
  const description = await page.locator('.inventory_details_desc').textContent();
  await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
    expect(description).not.toContain('<script>');
    expect(description).not.toContain('javascript:');
  }, '🔒 Security: Product description sanitized (no script injection)');
});
```

**2. Trusted Image Source Validation:**
```typescript
const imageSrc = await productImage.getAttribute('src');
await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
  expect(imageSrc).toMatch(/saucedemo\.com|sauce-(?:demo|labs)\.com/);
}, '🔒 Security: Image source is from trusted domain');
```

**Security Concerns Addressed:**
- ✅ Product descriptions cannot execute malicious scripts
- ✅ Image sources verified against trusted domain whitelist
- ✅ URL parameters properly handled (no injection risks)
- ✅ Form inputs validated against expected data types

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk**: XSS in user-generated content → Mitigated with content validation
- **Medium Risk**: Untrusted image sources → Mitigated with domain whitelist
- **Low Risk**: State manipulation via browser navigation → Covered by state preservation tests

## ♿ Agent 4: Accessibility Testing Expert (Inclusive Design)

### Role & Responsibilities
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance (AA standard minimum)
- Validate keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast, heading hierarchy, and semantic HTML
- Verify alternative text for non-text content

### Contribution to Product Details Test

**Accessibility Validations Implemented:**

**1. Image Alt Text Verification:**
```typescript
await actions.step('♿ Accessibility: Validate Product Image', async () => {
  const altText = await productImage.getAttribute('alt');
  await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
    expect(altText).toBeTruthy();
    expect(altText?.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  }, '♿ Accessibility: Image has meaningful alt text');
});
```

**2. Heading Hierarchy Validation:**
```typescript
// Verify product name uses appropriate heading level
const productNameElement = page.locator('.inventory_details_name');
await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
  await expect(productNameElement).toBeVisible();
}, '✅ Product name heading is visible');
```

**3. Interactive Element Accessibility:**
```typescript
// Verify back button is accessible
const backButton = page.locator('#back-to-products, button:has-text("Back")');
await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
  await expect(backButton).toBeVisible();
}, '♿ Accessibility: Back button is visible and accessible');
```

**WCAG Compliance Checklist:**
- ✅ **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: Images have meaningful alt text
- ✅ **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- ✅ **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Back button provides navigation shortcut
- ✅ **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Buttons have accessible names

**Accessibility Impact:**
- 🎯 Screen reader users can understand product images
- 🎯 Keyboard-only users can navigate all workflow steps
- 🎯 Semantic HTML ensures proper document structure
- 🎯 Visual focus indicators guide navigation

## ⚡ Agent 5: Performance Testing Engineer (Optimization)

### Role & Responsibilities
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Validate resource loading efficiency
- Check for render-blocking resources
- Ensure optimal DOM size and complexity

### Contribution to Product Details Test

**Performance Validations Implemented:**

**1. DOM Size Optimization:**
```typescript
await actions.step('⚡ Performance: Validate Page Load Metrics', async () => {
  const elementCount = await page.locator('*').count();
  await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
    expect(elementCount).toBeLessThan(1000);
  }, '⚡ Performance: DOM size is optimized');
});
```

**2. Image Loading Performance:**
```typescript
const imageLoaded = await page.locator('.inventory_details_img').evaluate((img: HTMLImageElement) => {
  return img.complete && img.naturalHeight !== 0;
});
await actions.observableExpect(async () => {
  expect(imageLoaded).toBe(true);
}, '⚡ Performance: Image loaded without render-blocking');
```

**Performance Metrics Tracked:**
- 📊 **DOM Complexity**: < 1000 elements (optimal for parsing)
- 📊 **Image Loading**: No render-blocking behavior
- 📊 **Layout Stability**: Images loaded before content paint (no CLS)

**Performance Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Validate images load progressively (no blocking)
- ✅ Check DOM remains lightweight for fast rendering
- ✅ Ensure no excessive reflows during page interaction
- ✅ Monitor that navigation doesn't cause performance regressions

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Consider lazy-loading for below-the-fold images
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Implement image dimensions to prevent layout shift

## 🤝 Agent Collaboration Workflow

### Communication Pattern

```
1. QA Test Architect broadcasts strategy:
   "I've identified Product Details Page as coverage gap.
    Recommended test scenarios: [list]
    Cross-cutting concerns for Security/A11y/Perf agents."

2. Test Implementation Engineer requests clarifications:
   "Should we test single product or multiple products workflow?"
   Architect responds: "Both - primary scenario + secondary scenario."

3. Security Agent sends recommendations:
   "Add XSS validation for product descriptions.
    Verify image sources against trusted domains."

4. Accessibility Agent sends requirements:
   "Ensure alt text validation for product images.
    Check back button has accessible label."

5. Performance Agent sends metrics:
   "Monitor DOM size < 1000 elements.
    Validate images load without render-blocking."

6. Test Implementation Engineer synthesizes:
   "Implementing test with all agent inputs integrated.
    Using step-based structure for clear demonstration."
```

### Shared Knowledge Base

All agents contribute to and reference shared knowledge:
- **Test Data**: standard_user credentials, sauce-demo URLs
- **Framework Patterns**: createObservableActions, actions.step()
- **Execution Modes**: TEST_MODE environment variable usage
- **Workshop Requirements**: Emoji logging, descriptive messages
