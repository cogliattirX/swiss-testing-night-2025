# Copilot Context Validation Checklist

## Pre-Prompt Checklist ✅

Before creating any Copilot prompt, verify:

### Context Inclusion (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Referenced `.copilot-instructions.md` for project context
- [ ] Included the standard context block in prompt
- [ ] Specified target application (Sauce Demo e-commerce)
- [ ] Mentioned framework (Playwright + TypeScript)
- [ ] Referenced architecture pattern (Page Object Model)

### Persona Assignment (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Selected appropriate primary persona from enhanced-qa-team-personas.md
- [ ] Included persona experience level and focus areas
- [ ] Specified critical reviewer for the persona
- [ ] Defined review criteria and quality concerns

### Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [ ] Specified atomicity and isolation requirements
- [ ] Required meaningful assertions and error handling
- [ ] Referenced relevant documentation (test-strategy.md, etc.)
- [ ] Included workshop demonstration requirements

## Post-Generation Validation ✅

After Copilot generates code, verify:

### Technical Standards
- [ ] Uses Playwright best practices (auto-waiting, proper selectors)
- [ ] Follows TypeScript conventions and type safety
- [ ] Implements Page Object Model where appropriate
- [ ] Uses data-test attributes for stable selectors
- [ ] Includes proper error handling and timeouts

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test names are descriptive and behavior-focused
- [ ] Assertions are comprehensive and meaningful
- [ ] Test data uses project standards (standard_user, etc.)
- [ ] Code is documented with appropriate comments

### Workshop Readiness
- [ ] Code can be demonstrated in 30-minute session
- [ ] Test runs reliably in workshop environment
- [ ] Demonstrates AI-powered testing concepts clearly
- [ ] Includes educational value for participants

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Uses environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Follows security testing best practices
- [ ] Considers accessibility and compliance requirements

## Common Issues & Fixes

### ❌ Missing Context
**Problem**: Generic code without project-specific context
**Fix**: Always include the standard context block from `.copilot-instructions.md`

### ❌ No Persona Specified  
**Problem**: Generic testing approach without specialized perspective
**Fix**: Select specific persona from enhanced-qa-team-personas.md and include reviewer

### ❌ Hardcoded Values
**Problem**: Test contains hardcoded URLs, credentials, or configuration
**Fix**: Reference playwright.config.ts and use environment variables

### ❌ Flaky Selectors
**Problem**: Uses unreliable CSS selectors or text-based selection
**Fix**: Request data-test attributes and Playwright's auto-waiting features

### ❌ Workshop Inappropriate
**Problem**: Code too complex or unreliable for 30-minute demonstration
**Fix**: Simplify while maintaining educational value and reliability

## Validation Commands

Run these to verify generated code:

```powershell
# Check test syntax
npx playwright test --dry-run tests/[new-test].spec.ts

# Run specific test  
npx playwright test tests/[new-test].spec.ts --headed

# Verify all tests still pass
npx playwright test

# Generate report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Success Criteria

Code passes validation when:
- ✅ Includes proper project context
- ✅ Uses specified persona and reviewer approach
- ✅ Follows all technical standards
- ✅ Demonstrates clear educational value
- ✅ Runs reliably in workshop environment
- ✅ Maintains consistency with existing test suite
