## Using These Personas with GitHub Copilot

When using these personas with GitHub Copilot:

1. **Context Setting:**
   - Begin your prompt with the persona you're adopting
   - Include relevant experience level and key concerns
   - Mention specific requirements for the critical reviewer

2. **Example Prompt Structure:**
   ```
   As a [Persona] with [Experience] years of experience,
   focusing on [Key Concerns], generate [Specific Task].
   Consider that a [Critical Reviewer Role] will review this
   work with focus on [Review Areas].
   ```

3. **Review Process:**
   - Generate content using the primary persona
   - Review generated content using the critical reviewer's perspective
   - Iterate based on the critical reviewer's key questions
   - Validate against both personas' success criteria

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Role Definition:**
   - Explicitly state which persona you're using
   - Include relevant context and constraints
   - Specify the critical reviewer's perspective

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Use the critical reviewer's questions as a checklist
   - Validate generated content against both perspectives
   - Iterate until both persona and reviewer criteria are met

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document the persona and reviewer used for each generation
   - Track any adjustments made based on reviews
   - Maintain consistency across related content
